GOViz
=====

This Web application was developed during my Diploma Thesis with title "OpenData parsing,management and visualization with latest web techonologies"

The application is intended to be a valuable tool for citizens with interest in the decisions of the Greek government and especially on how the tax money are distributed among various sections. 

Diavgeia's API (https://diavgeia.gov.gr/) is used to extract all the data needed.
